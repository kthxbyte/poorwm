PoorWM is an extremely limited window manager for X11. The only 
interaction it implements is window switching by pressing Alt+Tab. 
There are no window borders, no maximize/minimize/close, nothing.

This project started right after finding TinyWM by Nick Welch, 
whose code was quickly studied and slightly modified to implement 
window switching, the only feature I needed in a window manager 
for my NEC MobilePro 900C handheld running JLime. Anything else 
is overkill for that tiny 640x240 screen.
